#tuple is the immutable data types in python which means you can't change the values 
t = (1,2,3,4,2,2,5,6,7,7) #example of tuple
print(t[0])
#t[0]=1  you can't change the value of tuple just its the defference in the list and the tuple 
# a =() this is empty tuple
# a =(1,) This is way to defined a single element in a tuple 


#tuple methods
print(t.count(2))  #this method will count the given number how times that number is repeated
print(t.index(7))
